# izdwuut's blog
See those arcane source files? I feed [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with them and he yields [this gorgeous site](https://izdwuut.github.io
) in return (residing in [the master](https://github.com/izdwuut/izdwuut.github.io/tree/master) branch). In principle it works pretty much the same as GitHub-native static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Go grab one of these and forget your everyday Wordpress extravaganza!

# License
I license my blog sources under an MIT license. You can read it in it's entirety [here](https://github.com/izdwuut/izdwuut.github.io/blob/dev/LICENSE).

Since I host the blog on GitHub, it came as obvious to me to upload sources along generated files. I decided to use the MIT License because I find it really permissive, cool and whatnot. More so, it goes well with the license of [hugo-paper](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-paper/) theme that I implemented and thoroughly altered.

I think that it's of value to note that I'm not the author of Hugo logo as can be seen in the site's footer. 
The terms under which I use it [were briefly outlined](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/hugo-logo-terms-of-use/3422/5) by one of the project's creators.
