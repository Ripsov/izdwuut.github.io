[I was a gamer once](https://steamcommunity.com/id/izdwuut/recommended). There ought to be a [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)-standardized way to open several links in one click so I wound't have to explicitily say that it was cliché Skyrim reference. Every single night I silently weep because I find no real interest in video games as of lately. Actually that's mostly because I feel deep solitude caused by a gargantuic hole in my heart which is unlikely to get fixed in the foreseeable future. But yeah, I miss games.

Phew. Not so big of a burden when you decide to finally throw it out. Katharsis of sorts.

Oh, and I was also an avid black metal fan but I discovered that it made my acne go haywire. Ever heard about plants growing stronger while on some classical tunes? It was that, I'm certain. The fact that I still look like a Minesweeper ad is the whole different story and there is no corellation whatsoever. Now I'm more into pop or anything with over 30 millions views on YT in particular. I think that it makes me feel a lot saner. But hey, let me know if [Mgła](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt5_hI3ySCw) has released a new odiferous miasma. 


Fast-forward to today, I'm a programmer. Not too big of a personal growth now, is it?
