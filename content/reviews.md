Video games are cool, aren't they? Once I was under an impression that I'm able to finish every single item on my backlog. Suprisingly I'm not. But it was great quest nonetheless! I signed for reviewing every title that I will manage to finish. I was mostly publishing my reviews on Steam, thanks to it's built-in feature. For games that I didn't own on that platform, I published them on Metacritic. It has greatly improved my English skills and was plain fun. Here are my impressions:
