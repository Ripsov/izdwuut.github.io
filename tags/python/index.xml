When you run a Flask developement server, it tells you that it isn&amp;rsquo;t suited for prodution:
WARNING: This is a developlment server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Fair point. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tested for security and whatnot. There are a few alternatives, most notably Nginx and Apache. I go for the latter.</description></item><item><title>Create your own Youtube Thumbnail Downloader in Python</title><link>/tutorials/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 11:36:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/</guid><description>The idea is pretty simple. Given the URL to a Youtube video, the script spews out it&amp;rsquo;s thumbnail. See this lovely image? It would make for a perfect wallpaper and I wrote a script that does just that.
How would Python render it possible, you&amp;rsquo;d ask? By working hand-in-hand with Youtube API, of course! I should seriously reconsider becoming a clown. I have a hunch that it would come as natural to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
