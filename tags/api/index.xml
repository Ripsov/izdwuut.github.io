Be sure to check the previous ones here. In this one, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover a script that upvotes every new submission and comment from a given subreddit. Please, don&amp;rsquo;t try to run it in reverse and downvote all the things. Please&amp;hellip;
I assume that you have Python installed on your system. The tutorial targets Windows 10 with Powershell.
