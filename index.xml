I do my best to report issues and propose improvements as soon as I notice them. Sometimes I find it difficult because there might be no bug tracker or it may be so obscure that I can&amp;rsquo;t help but flee. Because my reports are scattered all over various places, I decided to collect them in here.</description></item><item><title>Reviews</title><link>/reviews/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 09:05:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>/reviews/</guid><description>Video games are cool, aren&amp;rsquo;t they? Once I was under an impression that I&amp;rsquo;m able to finish every single item on my backlog. Suprisingly I&amp;rsquo;m not. But it was great quest nonetheless! I signed for reviewing every title that I will manage to finish. I was mostly publishing my reviews on Steam, thanks to it&amp;rsquo;s built-in feature. For games that I didn&amp;rsquo;t own on that platform, I published them on Metacritic.</description></item><item><title>IS THIS THING RECORD O hi there!</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 13:26:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello world! I&amp;rsquo;m Bartosz. Now that I have your attention, why don&amp;rsquo;t you follow this inconspicuous and harmless link and click OK in every window that appear on your screen? Much obliged.
This is it! My much awaited blog. Admit it, you was looking forward to check out what nonsensical thoughts I managed to came up with. Wait until you see my prime time commercials. I think (I hope) that it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I&amp;rsquo;m going to dedicate this place to some programming-related stuff.</description></item><item><title>Exceedingly entertaining piece of information about my humble and awe-inspiring persona</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 13:11:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>I was a gamer once. There ought to be a W3C-standardized way to open several links in one click so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to explicitily say that it was a clich√© Skyrim reference. Every single night I silently weep because I find no real interest in video games as of lately. Actually that&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I feel deep solitude caused by a gargantuic hole in my heart which is unlikely to get fixed in the foreseeable future.</description></item></channel></rss>
