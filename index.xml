      <description>Hello world! I&amp;rsquo;m Bartosz. Now that I have your attention, why don&amp;rsquo;t you follow this inconspicuous and harmless link and click OK in every window that appear on your screen? Much obliged.
This is it! My much awaited blog. Admit it, you was looking forward to check out what nonsensical thoughts I managed to came up with. Wait until you see my prime time commercials. I think (I hope) that it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I&amp;rsquo;m going to dedicate this place to some programming-related stuff.</description>

      <description>I was a gamer once. There ought to be a W3C-standardized way to open several links in one click so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to explicitily say that it was a clich√© Skyrim reference. Every single night I silently weep because I find no real interest in video games as of lately. Actually that&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I feel deep solitude caused by a gargantuic hole in my heart which is unlikely to get fixed in the foreseeable future.</description>
